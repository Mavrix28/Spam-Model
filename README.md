Spam Detection Model

This project implements a Spam Detection Model using Python. The model classifies messages as either spam or ham (not spam), helping to filter unwanted messages efficiently. This README provides an overview of the setup, usage, and functionality of the spam detector.

Features

•	Text Classification: Identifies and labels messages as spam or ham.
•	Machine Learning Pipeline: A pre-trained model that can be fine-tuned for improved accuracy.
•	Data Preprocessing: Cleans and processes text data for reliable classification.

Model Details:

•	Algorithm: [Specify algorithm, e.g., Naive Bayes, SVM, or Neural Network]
•	Feature Extraction: [TF-IDF, Bag of Words, etc.]
•	Accuracy: [Provide accuracy if available]
